About this project
About
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard developed to analyze the sales and customer satisfaction metrics of a quick commerce grocery platform. The dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of grocery sales performance, product movement, and customer feedback to aid data-driven decisions.

Why I Created This Dashboard
Quick commerce businesses operate in a fast-paced environment with thousands of daily transactions. I wanted to transform this transactional data into actionable insights—providing a way for stakeholders to spot trends, optimize inventory, and understand customer satisfaction in real-time.

How I Approached the Project
Data Preparation and Cleaning
Used Power Query to clean raw transaction data and handle inconsistencies.
Ensured data types and formats were suitable for financial and categorical analysis.
Dashboard Design
Created a clean, interactive layout showing total sales (₹1.20M), average sale value (₹140.99), total items sold (9K), and average product rating (3.92).
Visuals include:
Category-wise sales breakdown
Monthly sales trends
Average ratings by product category
High/low-performing SKUs
Key Insights Derived
Sales Distribution: A small number of SKUs account for a large share of revenue—highlighting opportunities to optimize the product mix.
Customer Ratings: With an average rating of 3.92, most customers are satisfied, but the variance suggests room for improvement in certain categories.
Basket Size Insight: The average sale of ₹140.99 suggests most orders are small-sized, emphasizing the need for upselling strategies.
Inventory Management: Items with high volume but low average ratings may need quality reviews or replacements.
Tools Used
Power BI: Dashboard design, interactivity, and visual storytelling
Power Query: Data cleaning and transformation
Excel: Pre-analysis and validation
Final Thoughts
This project strengthened my ability to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights. It demonstrated how performance dashboards can enhance decision-making in the fast-moving world of quick commerce by combining sales trends with customer sentiment.
